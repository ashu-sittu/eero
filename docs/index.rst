Before you begin logging into your eero router, make sure you have the following:

Logging into Your eero Router Through the Mobile App
----------------------------------------------------
The primary method of logging into an eero router is through the official eero app. This app is available for both iOS and Android devices. The mobile app offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface for configuring your eero system, managing your network, and diagnosing issues.

**Step 1: Install the eero App**

1. Open the **App Store** (on iOS) or **Google Play Store** (on Android).
2. In the search bar, type "eero" and download the official app.
3. Once the app is installed, open it to get started.

**Step 2: Open the eero App and Log In**
After the app is installed, you can now log in to access your eero network.

1. Launch the eero app from your phone.
2. If you already have an eero account, tap on **Sign In**. Enter your **email address** and **password** to log in.
   - If you don’t have an eero account, tap **Create Account** and follow the on-screen instructions to create one.
3. Once you’re logged in, you’ll be taken to the home screen of your eero network dashboard.

**Step 3: Navigate the App for Router Settings**
Now that you’re logged in, you can access various settings for your eero router. Here are some key options:

- **Network Settings**: Adjust settings such as Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.
- **Device Management**: View and manage devices connected to your eero network, set priorities, or pause the internet for specific devices.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Check your network's overall performance and see how much bandwidth each device is using.
- **Guest Network**: Create and manage a guest Wi-Fi network for visitors.

Logging into Your eero Router via Web Interface

Although the eero mobile app is the primary method for managing your eero network, some users may prefer logging in via the web interface for more detailed configuration or troubleshooting. Though not all features are available through the web interface, it can still be useful for basic management tasks.

**Step 1: Connect to Your eero Network**
Make sure your computer is connected to the eero network before proceeding. You can connect via Wi-Fi or through an Ethernet cable directly to the eero router.

Once logged in to the eero app or web interface, you can manage your network and make necessary changes. Here are some of the key settings you can adjust:

Wi-Fi Settings**
One of the first things you’ll want to do is customize your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password. You can do this easily through the app under **Network Settings**. Additionally, you can enable or disable the **Guest Network** feature, allowing visitors to connect to your Wi-Fi without compromising your main network security.

Device Management**

- View the device’s details, including IP address and data usage.
- Pause internet access for specific devices (e.g., if you want to limit screen time for children).
- Prioritize certain devices to receive more bandwidth, ensuring smoother performance for activities like gaming or streaming.

Network Monitoring**
The eero app provides performance monitoring tools that allow you to see how your network is performing in real time. This includes monitoring data usage and bandwidth consumption by each connected device.

Firmware Updates**
Keeping your eero firmware up-to-date is important for optimal performance. The app will notify you when a new firmware update is available. You can check for updates under **Network Settings** and install them directly from the app.

Security Settings

eero routers come with built-in security features, such as WPA3 encryption, which ensures that your network is secure. You can adjust security settings in the app, enable automatic security updates, and monitor for any unusual activity on your network.
